# Game-Development-Masters-Portfolio
This is a portfolio containing previous projects I assembled in order to apply to master's programs in video game development at several schools, including UCF, SMU, University of Utah, RIT, WPI, Northeastern, UT Dallas, Drexel, and Penn.

In the Artificial_Intelligence directory are files needed for a project that can play a game of Othello.
